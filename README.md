# Project Title: Foodie Finder

Foodie Finder is a web application designed to help users discover and reserve tables at their favorite restaurants. It provides a user-friendly platform for browsing restaurants, making reservations, and managing bookings. Restaurant managers can efficiently handle reservation management through the system's dashboard.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication ensures only authorized access to the reservation system.

Restaurant Listings: The application displays a curated list of restaurants, showcasing details such as location, contact information, cuisine type, and operating hours.

Reservation Management: Users can easily make reservations at their preferred restaurants by selecting the desired date, time, and number of guests. To modify a reservation, users must delete their existing reservation and create a new one.

Manager Dashboard: Restaurant managers have access to a dashboard where they can efficiently manage reservations for their establishment. They can view upcoming bookings and update availability as needed.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a JavaScript library known for its component-based architecture. React Router facilitates seamless navigation between different pages.

Backend: The backend is developed using Python with Flask, a lightweight web framework. Flask provides endpoints to handle user authentication, restaurant management, reservation handling, and interactions with the SQLite database.

Database: The application utilizes SQLite, a lightweight and easy-to-use relational database management system. SQLite stores user data, restaurant details, and reservation information efficiently.

Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to protected routes and user data.

Styling: CSS is used for styling the frontend components, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.

Future Enhancements:

Integration with payment gateways to facilitate reservation deposits or prepayments.
Implementation of real-time notifications for users regarding reservation updates or changes.
Addition of Geolocation functionality to suggest nearby restaurants based on the user's location.
Expansion of features to include restaurant ratings and reviews, special offers, and table preferences.
Conclusion:

Foodie Finder simplifies the process of discovering and reserving tables at restaurants, offering a convenient solution for both users and restaurant managers. With its intuitive design and seamless functionality, Foodie Finder enhances the dining experience and fosters connections between food enthusiasts and their favorite eateries.
